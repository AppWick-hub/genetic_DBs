Rare de novo heterozygous missense variants that were predicted to be damaging have been observed in ASD probands from the Autism Sequencing Consortium (De Rubeis et al., 2014), as well as in ASD probands from the Autism Simplex Collection (TASC) and the Autism Clinical and Genetic Resources in China (ACGC) cohorts (Geisheker et al., 2017).  Biallelic variants in the DEAF1 gene have also been observed in individuals presenting with an autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder (dyskinesia, seizures, and intellectual developmental disorder; OMIM 617171); autistic features have been observed in a subset of these individuals (Rajab et al., 2015; Gund et al., 2016; Trujillano et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017).  Phentoypic characterization of a previously unreported cohort of 17 individuals with de novo DEAF1 variants and 5 individuals with biallelic DEAF1 variants in Nabais Sa et al., 2019 found that autism was present in 16 individuals with a de novo DEAF1 variant, as opposed to 1 individual with a biallelic DEAF1 variant.  Furthermore, many of the de novo DEAF1 variants reported by Nabais Sa et al., 2019 were experimentally shown to impair transcriptional regulation of the DEAF1 promoter.  Three additional de novo missense variants in the DEAF1 gene were identified in ASD probands from the Autism Sequencing Consortium in Satterstrom et al., 2020; subsequent TADA analysis of de novo variants from the Simons Simplex Collection and the Autism Sequencing Consortium and protein-truncating variants from iPSYCH in this report identified DEAF1 as a candidate gene with a false discovery rate (FDR)  0.01.  A de novo loss-of-function variant and three rare and potentially damaging missense variants in the DEAF1 gene were reported in ASD probands from the SPARK cohort in Zhou et al., 2022; a two-stage analysis of rare de novo and inherited coding variants in 42,607 ASD cases, including 35,130 new cases from the SPARK cohort, in this report identified DEAF1 as a gene reaching exome-wide significance (P < 2.5E-06).",32,0,,0,,24726472,,"26401017,30923367","21076407,23020937,24668509,25167861,25363760,25533962,26048982,26834045,27848944,28628100,28940898,29366832,30763456,31209962,31981491,32094338,33739554,34800434,35741772,35873028,35981081,35982159,36980980,37393044,37506195,37543562,38025430,38073621,38256266"

This gene was identified in Iossifov et al. 2015 as a strong candidate to be an ASD risk gene based on a combination of de novo mutational evidence and the absence or very low frequency of mutations in controls (PMID 26401017). Additional de novo LoF variants in POGZ were identified in White et al., 2016 in individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability and, in two cases, ASD (PMID 26739615). Furthermore, a review of clinical information in individuals with POGZ variants in this report identified shared phentoypic features (developmental delay/intellectual disability, hypotonia, behavioral abnormalities, similar facial features) and proposed that POGZ LoF variants were responsible for a form of syndromic intellectual disability.

A second de novo LoF variant in this gene was identified in an ASD proband from a simplex family from the ASD: Genomes to Outcome Study cohort by whole genome sequencing as part of the MSSNG initiative in Yuen et al., 2017.  Based on the discovery of two de novo LoF variants in this gene in ASD probands, a probability of LoF intolerance rate (pLI) > 0.9, and higher-than-expected mutation rate (false discovery rate < 15%), SMARCC2 was determined to be an ASD candidate gene in Yuen et al., 2017.  TADA-Annotations (TADA-A) analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from five studies with a total of 314 ASD-affected subjects in Liu et al., 2018 identified SMARCC2 as an ASD risk gene with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.3; among the de novo variants associated with this gene in ASD subjects was a loss-of-function variant and a splicing SNV.  Machol et al., 2018 reported 15 unrelated individuals with variants in the SMARCC2 gene that presented with a neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by developmental  delay/intellectual disability, speech delay, and hypotonia; behavioral abnormalities were also frequently observed in this cohort, with one individual presenting with ASD and three others presenting with difficulties with social interactions.  A de novo protein-truncating variant in SMARCC2 was identified in an ASD proband from the Autism Sequencing Consortium in Satterstrom et al., 2020; subsequent TADA analysis of de novo variants from the Simons Simplex Collection and the Autism Sequencing Consortium and protein-truncating variants from iPSYCH in this report identified SMARCC2 as a candidate gene with a false discovery rate (FDR) between 0.01 and 0.05 (0.01 < FDR  0.05).  Three additional de novo loss-of-function variants in the SMARCC2 gene were reported in ASD probands from the SPARK cohort in Zhou et al., 2022; a two-stage analysis of rare de novo and inherited coding variants in 42,607 ASD cases, including 35,130 new cases from the SPARK cohort, in this report identified SMARCC2 as a gene reaching exome-wide significance (P < 2.5E-06)..
